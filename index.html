  I was struck by the words I saw by chance. You went to college. You know the same thing about college societies; You know, college teachers only talk in class; You know there are only a few classes in college a day, but these classes are a day; You know, in college class, there are very few people who talk to each other, and no one surreptitiously passes notes; You know that in the five minutes after class, you will also get down like a large number of people in your senior year;You also found that after college students either go to the canteen or go back to the dormitory, in a hurry, nothing to say; You know that every time you receive a message from the meeting, @ all members are in front, and then you will receive a reply. You know that although college can fall in love, there are fewer people you like; You know college doesn't have a desk mate; You find that even though the campus is large, it seems to be very empty. Discover these, you seem to feel very lonely, miss high school time very much, then desperately with their high school classmates, pay attention to their daily dynamics, tell them you are lonely. Whenever you see talk about friendship, your alma mater, your hometown, you will be excited to forward. When someone sends a message that he's already home, you 'll be jealous. You will also find that some of the knowledge in the university is really difficult, and you did not listen to it during class. So you should comfort yourself that college should not only study, but should focus on exercising yourself, take out your mobile phone and start to brush your circle of friends or chat with QQ. After the chat, look at the time. It is also time to go back to the dormitory, back to the dormitory, found that everyone was playing there in silence with their mobile phones, this play did not stop before 12 o'clock. Think carefully, the college entrance examination has not done a few serious English reading questions so far. Then, again began the efforts around the clock .... suddenly, you stopped the pen in your hand. What's the difference between this and senior year? It's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of people missing.
